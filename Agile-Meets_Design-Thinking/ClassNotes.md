# AGILE MEETS DESIGN THINKING – CLASS NOTES

## Week 1 - Problems Agile solves     
"_The agile practices that deliver excellent product are well understood, but they take focus, energy, and confidence to apply. This week, we’ll identify what’s hard about creating excellent products and how agile can help. We'll begin with a discussion of the Agile Manifesto- what motivated it and how it defines agile. Then we’ll get into the practical part- the problems agile solves, how to focus your time and energy, and how you’ll know if your practice of agile is working._"

## Week 2 - Focusing your Agile with personas, problem scenarios and alternatives   
"_The best way to avoid building something nobody wants is to start with somebody in mind. In the design world, we talk about that "somebody" through a ‘persona’. Personas and problem scenarios (aka 'jobs-to-be-done') focus development on driving toward a valuable outcome for your user vs. just generating output. In this module, you’ll learn to focus your work by developing personas, problem scenarios, and alternatives using best practices from design thinking._"

### Week 2: How do actionable personas and problem scenarios help you avoid waste?

__Design Thinking for Agile User Stories__	
1:51 - 1:55
- _So, here we're going to be principally focused on these two items._
- Who is this person that we're going to build this product for? What makes them tick? What do they care about? We need to stay curious and at the same time stay organized about how we gather that understanding, encapsulate it, and share it with the rest of our team. And then we need to keep an eye on, what do they care about? And, how do we know if we are delivering something that's valuable to them?


__Creating and Using Personas__     
4:22 - 4:26
- _I made this checklist as a way to think through_
- Vivid. Good personas should be vivid. If you hand them to a collaborator or you reread them a week after you created them, you should feel like you know this user. 
- Actionable - they should help you make decisions and design ways to test whether what you are producing is valuable. 
- Real. The more you're out observing real users, and real customers if you have customers, the better off you're going to be with these personas. So rather than talking about, do we think Mary the mom would do this, or do that? Make some time, make an hour. 
- Identifiable. So that doesn't mean that they're demographically specific. But you should be able to consistently find these people. And a good litmus test for your personas is can you think of five people that match this persona off the top of your head. 
- Exact. People are complicated. If you design something for everybody, you're going to end up with something that's bland, and that nobody likes. 
- Detailed - Be descriptive.


__Focusing Your Persona: Think, See, Feel, Do__     
0:23 - 0:42
- _When we look at the think part of a persona, what we're really looking at is the cognitive part of what they would rationally say to you about your problem area that you're working on. And the best place to initially focus is on the tension between, how do they see things now in your area of interest?_


__Focusing Your Persona: Think, See, Feel, Do__     
2:11 - 2:46
- _As we transition over to the Sees part, here we're looking at how was their Think kind of shaped? What are the interactions, and media, and things that they look at that shape their perceptions? And this is important because this is how we will reach our user, this is how they will learn about our product, be that buying it, using it, continuing to use it, sharing it with others. And also, we just want to generally know, what does the persona see happening in our area of interest that they think is notable?_


__Focusing Your Persona: Think, See, Feel, Do__     
3:43 - 4:04
- _And then we get to Feels, this one is a little more challenging. So here we have to get at the emotional resonance of what the subject actually feels in our area of interest. And that the easiest way to do that is against the backdrop of a specific example that you've probably been talking about as you move through these other items._


__Focusing Your Persona: Think, See, Feel, Do__     
5:15 - 5:28
- _When we look at Does, here we're actually looking at, oftentimes, numeric specifics. And we're looking at, how often does the persona do this certain activity per whatever the period is, day, week, month, quarter?_
- Look for the workarounds. The things that our persona does in our area of interest to get by that may be important for us to think through their actual behaviors.


__Demo: Drafting Think, See, Feel, Do__     
0:00
- _All right, now we're going to detail the persona and operationalize it in our specific area of interest using think, see, feel, do._
- Think - what is the tension between how things are and how our persona would like them to be. Include why we believe these thoughts, these notions are important. 
- Sees - what are the key things that inform the persona's point of view, people they talk to, things that they read. Feels - How do these things that we've ascribed importance to make the persona feel? 
- Does - what are the factual parts of the job? How much does the persona work? How much money does he make? How many jobs does he do?


__Demo: Drafting Personas__     
0:01 - 0:05
- _We're going to put pen to paper now and draft a persona_
- Drafting a persona description: 
1. The first thing that I like to do personally when I draft a persona, is find a photo. I have this image to help humanize him. I often like to start with why the persona does whatever they do. 
2. The second thing that I like to look at is well, what's a typical day in the life for the persona. 
3. Next, I often like to look at kind of what are the tension points, the kind of issues that we've started to learn about. And we'll structure those in a more formal way when we move down to the problem scenarios. But I try to get at them a little bit circumstantially kind of here. 
4. And then finally, I like to close with, where is this persona headed? I mean what do they see in this area for themselves in the next whatever the time horizon tends to be that we find when we talk to them, a year or five years.


__Designing User Stories: Problem Scenarios__       
0:03 - 0:43
- _Here, we're going to look at problem scenarios. These are the fundamental needs, jobs to be done, desires that our user has that we're going to deliver on with our software. You'll learn how to take these and apply them in a practical way to thinking about if what you're doing is valuable or not. These are a disposition of the jobs that the customer is going to do, the needs or desires if your product is more about personal things and habits and gratification. And, this is a way of making sure that we don't build something for a habit or a job or desire that doesn't exist._
- Problem scenarios: define them at the right level of abstraction - the fundamental need, job, habit, or a desire. 
- Alternatives - Look at alternative scenarios especially what the customer is doing today to address the problem scenario. If this problem scenario really exists, the customer, the user is doing something about it today and learning about what they're doing is really important. 
- Value propositions - what are we doing/proposing that does a better job of solving this problem? Are we proposing something that's better enough than the alternatives (including what they are doing today) at solving this problem scenario where we're going to create a win? Central to agile is this idea of front loading value and staying focused on something that's valuable to the user.


__Designing User Stories: Problem Scenarios__       
3:41 - 4:26
- _We'll close with this idea of a product hypothesis. So we've talked about a culture of experimentation and how testing is central to agile. So, if we learn about these things, we can stitch them together in a nice testable formulation which is that, okay, our idea for this product or for this feature or this enterprise software deployment is that there's certain persona exists, user costumer. And they have these certain problems, these certain jobs, these certain habits whatever they are. Right now, they're doing these certain things to solve them. And, we have a proposition that better enough to cause them to want to use our site, use our enterprise software, read our site, use our site, whatever relationship we're trying to have with the customer._
- Product hypothesis - ___definition___ - a testable formulation in the following format, " There exists a persona (provide some details) that has a current problem or need (define in more detail), which they currently address by doing X, Y and Z, and this is my proposition that will be better than their current way of operating.


__Needfinding with Problem Scenarios__      
3:28 - 3:45
- _As you're formulating the problem scenarios, I recommend that you sort of think about what is the parent problem scenario. And are you kind of at the right level? What is your correct anchor problem scenario? If you go one level up in abstraction, maybe you'll find that that's actually the right one._



## Week 3 - Getting to Great Agile User Stories   
"_Now we’re going to transition from drafting personas and hypothesizing user needs to testing those assumptions and translating what you’ve learned into agile user stories. We’ll step through how you create an interview guide to ask your users the right questions and then we’ll dive into agile user stories. User stories are a standard feature of agile and serve as a day-to-day focal point for driving to value._"

### Week 3: How do you know what matters to the user?

__User Research for Busy People__   
7:19 - 7:38
- _But suffice to say for the moment that the techniques we're learning about here are good for the problem and the persona hypothesis, not good for the value hypothesis. We have a different set of techniques we'll use to put decisions in front of the user, and that'll help us get information about what they're actually going to prefer in practice._
- But you cannot ask them would you like this feature, would you like this product. You have to create a decision for them.


__User Research for Busy People__   
7:49 - 7:56
- _I will close with mention of a couple of other hypothesis areas that we will also principally focus on in course two._
- Value Hypothesis - Here you use evidentiary experiments, the kind of things they do in lean startup, if you're familiar with that. We'll learn about how to do that in course two. 
- Customer creation hypothesis - if we market to the customer in a certain way or promote the product in a certain way, then the customer will respond and buy or click through. 
- Usability hypothesis - if we put a red button here, the user will find it and use it in a way we expect. Those are best tested through a set of techniques we'll learn about in courses two and course four about testing. This is different from motivation which asks "Does the customer want a proposition that we have?"


__Researching Personas__    
1:08 - 1:26
- _These questions that you're seeing here correspond to the template interview guide that's on the Google Doc template that we'll look at shortly. And the key thing about doing these interviews is to start with very general questions and narrow towards more specific questions._
- We want to ask questions to complete the "think, see, feel, do" model and operationalize our persona and our area of interest.


__Researching Personas__    
5:22 - 5:31
- _So encourage them to think of an example, even if they think it's not perfectly representative and show them that you want to hear about the details, which is not normal._
- They'll think everything's not typical. You should just tell them to go ahead. At the same time, they think you want some kind of averaged out, generalized answer, which is absolutely not what you want. We want to get specifics, and then see how we can sort of generalize those into generally valuable things.


__Researching Personas__    
6:02 - 6:20
- _Remember, this is an interview guide. It helps you remember stuff, it helps you think about question formulations that work well. You should absolutely be editing it as you go along and you learn what works, and that's the hallmark of a good user researcher.
You're not trying to get statistically comparable data or get everybody to answer a question in exactly the same way. You're trying to have as normal a conversation as you can with these people while still getting at these areas of importance._


__Researching Personas__    
8:59 - 9:09
- _As you see here, this first column has the sort of generic form of the question and the second column has some specific examples that you can use to formulate your own questions._
- These questions are in the Google Docs templates to help you think about what you want to ask the subject.


### Week 3: How do you write your best possible user story?

__Preparing for Great User Stories__    
0:49 - 0:55
- _So as we create user stories, we're principally focused on how do we provide good experiences to the user._
- Tie the material about personas and problem scenarios that we covered in the previous module into your user stories. Answer the question of how are we going to do something that they're adequately motivated to use. Are we going to deliver software/value proposition that's better enough than the alternatives that they want to use it?


__Writing Great User Stories__    
1:19 - 1:29
- _Let's talk about these three clauses that you see for a minute, and why they're important, and how you can do really well on each of them consistently as you write user stories._
1. First, make sure we're constantly tying back to who is this user that we're going to to build something for. 
2. Second, what makes them tick, what do they care about? 
3. Third, reward is a discrete, successful conclusion to the user story.


__Writing Great User Stories__    
2:59 - 3:10
- _the stories, as we have discussed, they decompose into epics that then have child stories that create more detail for them._
- The term, epic, can be a little bit misleading. Most learners who first start to draft user stories, draft them too broad. An epic story isn't for instance, something that encapsulates the whole idea of your product, or even the whole idea of your feature in most cases. It's still relatively specific and discrete.


__Adding Test Cases to User Stories__   
3:15 - 3:20
- _In this video you learn how to supplement the level of detail on your user stories with test cases._
- Test cases are specific items that we're using to layer additional detail against user stories. Sometimes they're called acceptance criteria or given other names in other Agile sources. Basically we just mean that these are a testable formulation that allows us to add additional detail to our user stories.


__Demo: Drafting Epic User Stories__    
0:01 - 0:31
- _In this video, we're going to looking at drafting epic, agile user stories. As we discussed previously, we want these to follow from problem scenarios. Which are real needs, jobs, desires that exist on the part of the customer that we've gone out and researched, or at least made assumptions about. So what I recommend doing is, you've presumably already drafted some problem scenarios, I recommend organizing your epic user stories underneath those problem scenarios._


__Demo: Drafting Child Stories__    
3:29 - 3:43
- _So if you remember, we'll take this from the top. We have our problem scenario here, then we have one or more epics below that and then we use this table to keep our child stories and our test cases organized together as we draft._



## Week 4 - Focusing on Customer Value with User Stories      
"_The agile user story is your day-to-day focal point for making sure you’re building something valuable for your user. It’s how you discuss that within your team and how you anchor your subsequent testing. In this module, you’ll learn how to facilitate the creation and use of stories within your team._"

### Week 4: How do successful practitioners enhance their stories?

__Better Narrative, Better Story__    
0:08 - 0:28
- _In this lesson, we're going to look at some more advanced techniques to improve the quality of our users' stories. So let's go back to this epic that we've been playing with from the H and H team, and we're going to think about it in these terms: trigger, action, and reward._
- Trigger - something that initiates the problem scenario. I.e., siomething happens that makes the user take an action. Action - the thing(s) the user actually does in response to the trigger. 
- Reward - a conclusion to the story where the user experiences a small and discreet gratifaction, and can move on to the next thing.


__Better Narrative, Better Story__    
1:56 - 2:09
- _So one technique I like to use to think through epics and just really escalate the volume on the quiet screens of all the little details that we neglect to deliver to our users is story boarding._
- Storyboards are not only a good way to think through your ideas but to bring them to life for your collaborators.


__Better Narrative, Better Story__    
4:14 - 4:22
- _it's important not to force your epics into a simplistic view of users always doing what you expect.
- _The H and H epic we just went through fans out in the very beginning depending on does Ted know the part, does he not know the part, is he going to look it up? And then it moves forward to a more linear set of conclusions. It is not a straight line "happy path"._


__Investable Stories__    
0:00 - 0:05
- _A great technique to make your stories better is Bill Wake's Classic Invest Checklist._
- This is a set of questions to determine whether your user story is actionable. Is the story:  
1. Independent - can be implemented as a standalone piece of development
2. Negotiable - user story is not a hardened specification, but rather, something that can be collaboratively iterated 
3. Valuable - addresses one of the users' foundational sources of value
4. Estimable - can predict cost and length to develop
5. Small - fits into a small batch release
6. Testable - can you test early using mock-ups or other trials


__Coaching for Better User Stories__    
0:00 - 0:16
- _In the last couple of videos, you've learned techniques to make your stories better so you can drive to the heart of what's valuable for the user. Let's walk through some practice together so that you get a sense of how that might work in the real world in your own practice of writing great user stories._


__Coaching for Better User Stories__    
1:45 - 1:57
- _what I would do personally with this story is, I would take the kind of vague, general stuff, and I would make sure I decomposed it into problem scenarios, because yeah, it's important to satisfy the customer._


__Coaching for Better User Stories__    
4:12 - 4:30
- _A few tips as you're writing user stories and you're coaching the rest of your team on how to do it. First, be encouraging. Use phrases like, how might we make this story more testable? How might we bring some of the things that we saw out on the field into this user story?_


__A Prototype Is Worth a Thousand Meetings__    
0:01 - 0:25
- _You've learned a few techniques to improve your Agile user stories, drive better discussions. Now, I'm going to show you how to use one of my personal favorites, prototyping. There's the saying, a prototype is worth a thousand meetings. And I think that that comes from a couple places. One is that prototyping, or sketching your ideas, helps you make better user stories. It helps you think through what you're really intending_
- Use prototypes to build better user stories and drive better discussions. Three tips: 
1. Use existing patterns that the user is familiar with so that they don't have to learn anything new to get the reward. 
2. Draft multiple directions of the prototypes so that we can converge on the way that the user will actually behave.
3. Test each of the directions, early and often. Remember prototypes are impermanent and built to serve the testing.


__From Design Thinking to Agile Analytics__   
0:00 - 0:14
- _As you refine your design inputs and think about how you're going to drive to good outcomes, one of the things I just wanted to preview for you is this idea of tying analytics to your design work._
- We will come back to this in Course 4. Think about: 
1. Onboarding - what must the customer do to get the rewards? 
2. Engagement - How did they make a habit of this behavior? 
3. Retention - How do we know this behavior is creating good outcomes?


__Designing a Meeting with User Stories__   
6:36 - 6:48
- _Let's look at one more example before we close. So this is a meeting where they want to review problem scenarios and they're going to punch through and create some material to inform their next sprint._
- Use "Spend a Dollar" Game to prioritize the problem scenarios that you will address.


__Designing a Meeting with User Stories__     
3:57 - 4:12
- _Here's an example of how to design a meeting for a particular situation where you want to do a few things. You want to review personas and problem scenarios, and you're hoping that people will review the current personas._
- Get a strong and shared understanding of the primary and secondary users of the product. Use "Day in the Life" game, story boarding, for this purpose and to review user stories. Identify what you need to learn - i.e., prepare for a design sprint.


__Designing a Meeting with User Stories__   
3:01 - 3:07
- _Here are examples of questions that are good tools to bring this kind of thing forward._
- Types of questions that should drive your meetings:
1. Why: the five "why's" - Why do we think this is important to the user? 2
2. Who is this person and what problem are we solving?
3. How are we going to know if we're doing better than the alternative that the user currently has to do this job?
4. What is the reward in our story and how do we test it?


__Designing a Meeting with User Stories__   
0:00 - 0:18
- _You learn techniques to write great user stories, thread those back to sources of valuable narrative about the user. Now we're going to look at how to bring that material forward to the rest of your team with meetings, or really collaborative experiences, we'll call them._
- The three goals of designing a meeting with user stories: 
1. to elevate the teams understanding, allow them to understand what constitutes success and how you're going to verify that. What is a successful outcome and how do we get there? 
2. to create empathy with the end user - many team members will be unable to meet with end user directly. Does everyone understand the person that will determine the value of our efforts? 
3. to plan executions with thoughtful and valuable next steps. What should you build, what should you learn, and why?


__Using "Day in the Life" to Drive Empathy__    
0:16 - 0:36
- _Now, I mentioned I would talk more about Day in the Life, so I'm going to show you an example of that. Day in the Life is a game you play with a bunch of collaborators to help bring a persona to life. And the way it works is I'm going to show you a series of photos about a persona and now I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions about them._
- "Day in the Life" enables teams to humanize and get to know the user persona. This knowledge helps teams make better decisions and deliver a more valuable product.
