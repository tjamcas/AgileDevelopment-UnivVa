## HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT â€“ CLASS NOTES

### Week 1 - Introduction

__The Persona Hypothesis__    
0:00 - 0:08
- _Before we dive into each of the individual hypothesis areas, I thought we might loop through a few overviews._
- Overview/Recap Persona - a humanized, but specific view of who the user is, and what makes them tick.    


__The Problem/JTBD Hypothesis__    
0:01 - 0:06
- _Let's talk about the problem or job to be done hypothesis._
- Overview/Recap Problem / Jobs to be Done (JTBD) - an underlying need of the persona - i.e., durable problem, job, habit, desire that exists out there that we've observed. It is de-coupled from our proposition (proposed solution) because the problem/JBTD is extremely durable but the solution may change. The JTBD is found by interviews and his done in conjunction with the interviews for defining the persona.    


__The Demand/Value Hypothesis__    
0:00 - 0:09
- _Well, let's talk about this value or demand hypothesis, and how we go through and how we ask and answer these questions._
- Value or demand hypothesis - a hypothesis that a proposition to the current alternative or workaround will result in a more favorable or valuable outcome. The Value Hypothesis is easy to draft if you have a well-researched persona and problem/JTBD hypothesis. It may seem obvious, but it will help the team focus. In the context of Lean Startup, an MVP (minimally viable product) is developed as a product proxy to avoid wasted development and poor launches. It is not version 1.0 of the solution or product.    


__The Usability Hypothesis__    
0:00 - 0:03
- _Let's talk about the usability hypothesis,_
- Usability Hypothesis - Agile user stories that are informed by the persona, problem/JTBD, and value hypotheses. Method: storyboard how the intended persona/user will use your product. Develop parallel prototypes and test each to see which one is more usable by the targeted persona.


__The Functional Hypothesis__    
0:00 - 0:15
- _As we look at this next hypothesis area, we're going to move from this domain of continuous design over to this domain of continuous delivery. We're going to look at this functional hypothesis and how we do this work._
- Functional Hypothesis - takes the form of, Given [the user is in some context], When [the user indicates some preference or desire] And [the user commits, takes an action or makes a request] Then [a result occurs]


### Week 1 - Identifying & Testing Persona & Problem Hypothesis

__Example Personas and Problem Scenarios__    
0:38 - 0:48
- _what we're trying to do with these personas is tell a story, humanize this customer or this user for yourself and your team and really think about who they are and what makes them tick._


__Setting Up Interviews__    
2:18 - 2:20
- _Finally, what about the interviews themselves?_
- Logistics to conducting interviews - rated most to least favorable 1. In person - in situ 2. In person - ex situ 3. Video call 4. Phone call


__Prepping for Subject Interviews__    
0:00 - 0:14
- _Let's say you're ready to invest in investigating your persona, your job to be done hypotheses. You're going to go out and talk to some subjects. How do you get ready? Think about how you're going to do this. Well, here's how I like to do it in general._
- For a new persona, 1. Draft Persona 2. Draft Interview Guide (not a questionnaire, rather a guide that goes from general to specific) 3. Conduct interviews 4. Revise Persona and Problem/JTBD - as you continue to conduct interviews 5. Test - test whether the interviews are answering the questions that you set out to explore.


__Conducting the Interview__  
0:14 - 0:17
- _Here's a checklist of things that you want to make sure of._
- Checklist:
1. Screener question. Do you have a screener to confirm that you are dealing with a person who fits your persona? 
2. Interview guide. Do you have an interview guide? 
3. Intro script. Do you have an introduction script that describes how you're interested in what they do? Do not introduce what you plan to build. Do not assume that they are familiar with being an interview subject. You can tell them generally what you're up to, but don't give them specifics. Instead, tell them that you'd like to hear about who they are, how they do things, or what their concerns may be. 
4. Paperwork. Do you have any required releases? How will you take notes during the interview? 
5. Day in the Life. Do you intend to follow up with them in a Day in the life exercise?


__Conducting the Interview__  
4:36 - 5:02
- _And what we really want to do there is anchor in a specific example. And this is hard, because what they'll usually tell you paradoxically is like, that last example isn't really typical. But really they're all atypical. They think you want some averaged out generic answer, and that is the opposite of what you want. So, you're going to tell them, hey, can you tell me about the last time? That wasn't typical. You just tell them, that's okay, just tell me about the last time.__
- When interviewing to uncover the interview subject's experience, in reality, all answers rooted in actual experience are atypical. Make sure they know that's perfectly ok so that they give you the most valuable feedback possible.


### Week 1 - Intro to Design Sprints

__You and Your Next Design Sprint__
0:00 - 0:09
- _Design sprints are a way that teams make time to do the work of continuous design in their Agile cadences._
- Design sprints are time boxed (1-5 days), structured, and focused on answering a design question, and then moving on. They can take different formats: e.g., interviews for persona and problem hypothesis, run and test an MVP (minimally viable product), test usability.
